# Purposes
The purpose of this project is to create maps using various of mapping packages, particularly leaflet, leaflet.extras, etc to analyze the senior housing space. I specifically selected to focus only on Brookdale Senior Living as it is the largest provider in the U.S.. The codes I wrote can be reproduced and used in analyzing other major players in a different healthcare industry. It can be used during the M&A pre-screening stage by reviewing the existing locations or affiliates of a company on a map and assisting the business development team( M&A team) to explore which states the company has yet expanded into. Once, the states that the company has not yet expanded into been map out on a map, we can easily conduct the next preliminary analysis, which can be done through API into the US Census data. We can retrieve the data based on the company's strategic M&A criteria, like growth of population, income level, or growth of elerly population. After, we have finished conducting the preliminary research and selected some of the top locations based on the company's strategic M&A criteria, we can proceed further into setting the radius of the proposed locations to the existing locations. This will comes in handy especially if the company operate in an industry where the acquired doctors chairside at a close-by location.

Furthermore, the codes can also be used to support denovos projects. Again, by mapping out all the existing locations, the DeNovos department will be able to view the existing locations on a map and come up with some locations for DeNovos activities. 

## Additional Information
In my analysis, the dataset that I found on the Homeland Infrastructure Foudation-Level is not up-to-dated. As of now, Brookdale has already expanded into the proposed state that I recommended in my project, which is Oregon. 

# Project Scope(steps?) 
1. Examine the dataset 
2. Examine and map out the closed locations
3. Examine the numbers of existing locations 
4. Remove closed locations
5. Map out the existing locations on a heatmap 
6. Identify which states the company has market presence vs states with no market presence 
7. Conduct initial market research based on the company's M&A strategic goals 
8. API into the US Census data as needed to find data
9. Map out the census data 
10. Proposed new market opportunities based on the company's targeted strategic goals 
11. Map out the open and recommended locations
